🔥 How a Firewall Filters Traffic (Summary)

A firewall protects a system by controlling network traffic based on predefined security rules. It examines every incoming and outgoing packet and decides whether to allow, block, or reject it.

✅ Core Steps in Firewall Traffic Filtering
1. Packet Inspection

The firewall analyzes each packet’s:

Source & destination IP addresses

Port numbers (e.g., 22, 80, 443)

Protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)

Packet state (NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED)

2. Rule Matching

Traffic is compared against a rule set:

ALLOW → Packet is allowed through

DENY/BLOCK → Packet is dropped

DEFAULT POLICY → Used when no rule matches

Rules are processed top to bottom.

3. Direction-Based Filtering

Firewalls filter traffic depending on where it’s going:

Inbound traffic → Coming into the system

Outbound traffic → Leaving the system

Example:
Blocking inbound Telnet (port 23) while allowing outbound web traffic.

4. Port & Service Control

Firewalls can allow or block traffic for specific services:

Open port → Service reachable

Blocked port → Service inaccessible

Example:
ufw allow 22/tcp → Allows SSH
ufw deny 23/tcp → Blocks Telnet

5. Stateful Filtering

Modern firewalls track active connections:

Automatically allow return traffic

Block unsolicited or suspicious packets

This prevents attacks like spoofing or random connection attempts.

6. Logging & Monitoring

Firewalls log allowed/blocked traffic to help:

Detect intrusions

Debug connectivity issues

Audit security activity

Example:
Linux UFW log: /var/log/ufw.log

🎯 Summary 

A firewall is a traffic gatekeeper that checks packets against rules and only lets safe, allowed traffic pass through.
